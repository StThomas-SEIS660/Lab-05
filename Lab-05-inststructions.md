# IT Infrastructure Lab 5 Instructions #
**Overview**

Lab objectives:
Examine the details of an end to end DevOps pipeline and participate in it using your development environment.

outline

first, the default is not for each student to install their own entire pipeline on the server. the server will not scale to that level, and it's too much complexity for me to support.

so, we need to stand up ONE pipeline.

they need to examine the chain step by step and run small experiments

we need a lab that has the students collaborating on making small contributions to the application in a distributed way.

they each need to add a small piece of functionality with a small test case

they need to check out, make changes, refresh & sync & test locally, then push and run the build.

then deploy to production.

what about breaking and backing out? reverting?

will need XWindows working for Jenkins and Artifactory.
